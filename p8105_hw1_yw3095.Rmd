##problem 1:
This problem focuses on plotting and the use of inline R code.

First we create a dataframe:
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = runif(10, 0, 5),
  vec_logical = c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE),
  vec_char = c("good","bad", "good","good","good","bad","good","good","good","bad"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten"))
)
```
examine classes
```{r}
class(hw1_df$vec_char)
class(hw1_df$vec_factor)
```
